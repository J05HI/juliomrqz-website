# My Personal Website

This is the website that powers `marquez.co`, built on top of [Vue.js][vue] and [Nuxt.js][nuxt], and deployed to the cloud via [Vercel](vercel).

This website is for my blog posts and a place for Who I am. I also run some experiments on this website around web development that allows me to be up to date with the latest technologies.
