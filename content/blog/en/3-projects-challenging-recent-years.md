I'm a dynamic and motivated Full Stack Developer with more than 10 years of experience. I started as a Freelance in Web projects focused on the Frontend but over the years my knowledge was diversified by getting involved in scientific projects that required complex resources (statistics, pattern identification, data analysis, interpretation of third-party research, etc.), as well as web projects focused on the Backend. 

Over the years, I have only used intuitive languages with an acceptable percentage of market presence: JavaScript, PHP and Python. I prefer to work on projects that combine innovation and quality. That kind of projects fulfil me the most because new great things can be created. 

In the latest years, I've worked on great projects, three of them have challenged me considerably, they have tested my ability to solve problems, also, to remind me my love for creating new things and making contributions to the community. Today, I present you those three projects: Statusfy, Mapset and my first Scientific Research.

## A Marvelous Open Source Status Page system

[Statusfy][statusfy-home] is a Status Page System, easy to use and completely **Open Source**. The goal behind was to lower costs and complexity providing a simpler and versatile Open Source alternative.

You can find several alternatives, but Statusfy is different, it was designed to generate a Status Page Systems that work as a **Progressive Web Application** with the JAMstack and [Serverless][serverless-home] architecture in mind.

It's created with Vue, [Nuxt.js][nuxt-home], [Tailwind CSS][tailwindcss-express] and Express. Besides, the System Incidents are created using Markdown and Statusfy generates all the needed logic for the final Status Page System.

## Design, Create and Convert mainframe files through a dynamic interface

[Mapset][mapset-home] is an innovative and dynamic cloud-based tool designed for managing screens in different mainframe coding languages, it allows you to Design, Create and Convert mainframe files through a dynamic interface.

I was in charge of leading the project, creating most of the business logic in the backend (using Python as well as working on the frontend the minor tasks. We used Angular with TypeScript because was the best choice at that time. I think that those two technologies are great for Enterprise Web Applications. We also use React.js for the Marketing Website and Public Documentation.

When we started creating Mapset, we focused on three things: Innovation, Efficiency, and Convenience (a great combination 🤓). Mapset became 15x faster than conventional methods or any other tool available. It's inexpensive, very easy to use and users don't need to be a COBOL or CICS expert.

Due to we wanted to offer a low-cost solution, we had to lower our server expenses, so a Serverless deployment with AWS Lambda was a great fit.

## Scientific Research

When I was at college, I worked as a Research Assistant in the **Satellite Geodesy and Seismotectonics Laboratory** of the *Simon Bolivar University* (Caracas, Venezuela). We worked for a few years in a very interesting project, finding *the interaction of the North Andes plate with the Caribbean and South American plates in northwestern South America from GPS geodesy and seismic data*. 

The work done on this project taught me many things: statistics, data analysis, interpretation of third-party research in addition to the importance of the teamwork, great communication and the commitment to your boss and to the community to whom you're trying to give you scientific input.
