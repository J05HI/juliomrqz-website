We are very thrilled to introduce you another module we created for the Nuxt.js ecosystem: **Nuxt Optimized Images**, a new way to automatically optimize images used in your projects (JPEG, PNG, SVG, WebP and GIF).

You can now easily reduce the size of your images up to 60%, but this is not the only thing that can be done:

* **Reduces image size** by optimizing images during build.
* Improves loading speed by providing **progressive images**.
* **Inline small images** to save HTTP requests and additional roundtrips.
* Adds a **content hash** to the file name so images can get cached on CDN level and in the browser for a long time.
* Same image URLs over multiple builds for long time caching.
* Provides **query params** for file-specific handling/settings.
* JPEG/PNG images can be **converted to WebP on the fly** for an even smaller size.
* Can **resize** images or generate **low-quality image placeholders** and extract the **dominant colors** of it.

## Getting Started

Getting started is simple, just install the module as follows:

```bash 
npm install @aceforth/nuxt-optimized-images # or yarn add @aceforth/nuxt-optimized-images
```

Add `@aceforth/nuxt-optimized-images` to the modules section of `nuxt.config.js`:

```js
{
  modules: [
    '@aceforth/nuxt-optimized-images',
  ],
}
```

You can now import or require your images directly in your Vue components:

```html

<template>
  <picture>
    <source :srcset="require('~/assets/my-image.jpg?webp')" type="image/webp" />
    <source :srcset="require('~/assets/my-image.jpg')" type="image/jpeg" />
    <img :src="require('~/assets/my-image.jpg')" />
  </picture>
</template>

<!-- 
 Results in:

<picture>
  <source srcset="/_nuxt/images/d6816ecc.webp" type="image/webp" />
  <source srcset="/_nuxt/images/5216de42.jpg" type="image/jpeg" />
  <img src="/_nuxt/images/5216de42.jpg" />
</picture>
-->

```


There are several additional options you can specify as **query params** when you import the images, just follow [the documentation][nuxt-optimized-images-docs-usage] for more information.
