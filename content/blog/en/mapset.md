Today, we're happy to Introduce Mapset. A new, innovative and dynamic tool designed for managing screens in different mainframe coding languages. This tool means time savings due to its low execution time. Mapset allows designing BMS files without the need to worry about errors thanks to the validation system, this easily identifies errors quickly and easily.

You can draw through a Drag & Drop interface, generate a new BMS from scratch or any other existing BMS and generate HTML code from BMS files in seconds.

When we started creating Mapset, we focused on three things: Innovation, Efficiency, and Convenience. Mapset became 15x faster than conventional methods or any other tool available. It's inexpensive, very easy to use and users don't need to be a COBOL or CICS expert.

## Advantages

Mapset comes with some new, innovative features that make it a unique product in the market:

### 1. Cloud-Based

It allows you to design and modify BMSâ€™s from our Cloud-Based System and then generate the associate HTML in a graphic, dynamic and safe reliable way.

### 2. Inexpensive

This innovative product reduces the design and modification time of a BMS. The final product is completely free of errors. With an exponential learning curve, reducing training costs. "That mean savings to your company".

### 3. Faster

Mapset is 15x faster than conventional methods or any other tool available. It is very easy to use without being a COBOL or CICS expert.

### 4. File Conversion

With Mapset, we automatically generate HTML files from existing BMS by using the standards of your institution. Create Projects and upload BMS files to them individually or massively. Simplify operations with BMS files.

## How It Works

Mapset defines its essence in three fundamental pillars: Design, Create and Convert.

### Design

The core of the product is to draw through our Drag & Drop interface and summarize a several days job in just minutes. Design your BMS without the need to worry about errors thanks to the validation system. This identifies errors quickly and easily.

### Create

Allows you to generate a new BMS from scratch or any other existing BMS file using our re-engineering system. Create Projects and upload BMS files to them individually or massively. Simplify operations with BMS files.

### Convert

Automatically generate HTML or Text plain files from existing BMS by using the standards of your institution. With Mapset, we automatically generate HTML files from existing BMS by using the standards of your institution.

## Features

Mapset means saving due to its low execution time. Design, Create and Convert mainframe files through our dynamic interface.

### 1. Advanced Editor

A new, innovative and dynamic tool that helps you edit screens in different mainframe coding languages. Just draw through our Drag & Drop interface and summarize a several days job in just minutes.

### 2. Files Conversion

With Mapset, we automatically generate HTML files from existing BMS by using the standards of your institution. Create Projects and upload BMS files.

### 3. Different File Formats Generation

In addition to generating HTML files from your BMS, you can also download in plain text your designs created by our editor.

You can even generate PDF reports of your BMS designs to be evaluated and accepted by other people.

### 4. Analytics

You can track the events in your projects and therefore have a measurement solution that provides statistics on the use of your files and the participation of your team members.

Analytics reports help you to clearly understand how your team members behave so you can make decisions that help you optimize the performance of your teamwork.

### 5. Speed

Mapset is 15x faster than conventional methods or any other tool available. It is very easy to use without being a COBOL or CICS expert.
